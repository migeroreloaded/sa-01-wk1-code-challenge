### Toy Problem Challenges

This repository contains solutions to three toy problem challenges implemented in JavaScript.

#### Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator

Write a program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade:

- A > 79
- B - 60 to 79
- C - 49 to 59
- D - 40 to 49
- E - less 40.

#### Challenge 2: Speed Detector

Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

#### Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator

Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary.
